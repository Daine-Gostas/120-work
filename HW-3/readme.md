Daine Gostas; Section 50

1.) With a mixture of fear, anxiety, and hopelessness, I have struggled these past several weeks to figure out how to understand the several errors and issues that have bombarded me in the world of computer coding. Thanks to my professor Michael Musick and his guidance (essentially walkthrough) with this week's assignment, I have figured out the basics on how to begin each assignment and how Github Desktop, Atom, and the GitHub website all interact with each other to create the perfect coding environment. From this moment on I will begin my journey of catching up, and hopefully (most definitely), will be caught up with my assignments within the next couple of weeks. Thanks again for everything and wish me luck!

2.) For this assignment, I was shown how to delete my previous version of Atom entirely (since it was corrupted from my own doing), and how to successfully try again and link it with GitHub Desktop to make sharing files and tracking changes a breeze. From there I was also shown how to organize my files and how to label and start each assignment within Atom and what each page within the assignment folders represent. Then, I was shown how to upload these assignments onto the GitHub website via their designated urls and how each program works together to accomplish this. To conclude, I learned exactly how each assignment can physically be done through Atom (how to incorporate actual coding using the Atom program), and how to turn this coding into a url to be submitted onto the GitHub website.

3.) Through my own negligence the only way for me to solve my problems was to wait until I was terrified and desperate enough to actually seek help which in reality was available to me this entire time.

4.) The main thing I learned from this experience is that Michael Musick cares more about his students and their thoughts towards coding than the professor mindsets that are usually accepted at most universities, and that trying to learn something on your own is practically impossible and can easily be avoided if you simply put in the effort to get help from people who are happy and willing to do so.

5.) I was unable to help any students for the given week, but I hope to bring the knowledge I have learned to those like me who have struggled with this too.
