# Work Summary

For this week I learned about OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, which is basically a type of programming that allows the user to assign different things various attributes. After watching the tutorial videos on the [MART Website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-11/shiffman/), I found this method to be pretty straightforward as well as interesting seeing how it could potentially make things easier for me in the coding world. The only real difficulties I had came with deciding how I would make this animated image incorporate the color scheme of purple, lime green, black, and white and still be aesthetically pleasing. With that, I think I managed to do a good job.
