# Work Summary

So for this week I learned that both arrays and creating your own functions can make coding a lot more simple and have code use a lot less room compared to the alternative. To work with these, I went back to my Homework 5 assignment and revamped it to include an array to add a title and functions that simplified the original coding and added clouds. The only issue I dealt with was finding a way to make the random number generator not repetitively run every time the draw function is called (made the snowflakes jump all over the screen). Because of this, I decided to do the rest by hand because the time it would take me to figure out the problem would be a huge hassle. Regardless, the coding was a lot less work with the help of the new created functions.
