# Work Summary

So for this week I decided to make a night animated picture with snowfall. To do this I watched the tutorials on the Creative Coding [website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-5/p5-variables/), and from there it was pretty easy once I figured out how the mouseX and mouseY functions worked and how to make variables that add up over time (don't forget to pay attention to the snow on the bottom of the screen and how it rises)! Despite the amount of time I had to put into making each individual snowflake, I would say this assignment was actually easier than the previous one. I look forward to HW 6!
