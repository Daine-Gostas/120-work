# Work Summary

For this week I learned how to make objects within code interact with each other through different files, classes, and a LOT of code. I used the ball example on the course website to start things off and I found it really interesting to learn how this is actually possible, even though the trial and error in terms of what I wanted to create was a bit rough. In the end, I decided to try and show what it's like to be very optimistic in life and how it can still feel like you are sometimes invisible to the rest of the world (kind of depressing but I felt it worked well visually given this project). The one thing I had trouble with was the speed of the circles when I tried to add a lot more of them. I settled on 500 but would rather have had the screen filled up almost completely.

Thank you for the amazing year Michael Musick!
