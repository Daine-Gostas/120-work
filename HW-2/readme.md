# Week 2 Homework Summary

## Work Summary

The work I did this cycle mainly consisted of following the instructions exactly given to me from the MART120 website. Because I had completed week 3's assignment (with the help of Musick) before this one, it was incredibly easy to get started with and finish this one quickly.

## Steps Taken

The steps I took to complete this assignment consisted of:
1. Creating the files necessary to complete this
  - test1.txt file
  - test2.md file
    - to use as a resource
  - readme.md file
  - WhatToDo.txt file
    - To keep track of the assignment's requirements
  - Etc.

2. Following the instructions at the [MART120 Website](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-2/markup/) to complete each requirement
  - Creating this layout in test2.md to later copy/paste into readme.md
  - Completing test1.txt instructions


## Problems / Issues

The main problem I faced with this assignment was finding out how time consuming it is when you want everything to look perfect.
```
Look at how perfect this code block is.

Doesn't it look great?
```
Besides that, the work put into finding out how to make links and certain functions within this code really wasn't that bad.

Update: I found getting an image to work in Atom to be difficult.

## Things I Learned

Besides learning how to do everything you see here, I learned how easy it can be to do this once you know how all of the programs work together and that organization is KEY when it comes to coding.

This screenshot of my page should be a good representation of what I learned:
