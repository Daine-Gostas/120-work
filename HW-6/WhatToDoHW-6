WhatToDo

Unlike your previous p5 homework projects, where you explicitly coded each shape,
you are to create an algorithmic sketch this week. This algorithmic sketch should
leverage the draw {} function to create an evolving, algorithmic sketch.

This sketch should;

Use ‘global’ variables (variables declared outside of setup{} and draw{}) which,
are re-assigned every iteration of the draw loop.

The global variables can change in relationship to themselves,
or to other variables.
at least one of these variables, should be an object. (var myObj = {})
Devise algorithms with math operators and functions to dictate these evolving
relationships (i.e. you should write an algorithm that creates an artwork over time).

You might consider using any of the math functions listed under the “math” section on
the p5 reference page. You are expected to use at least two of the following functions.

abs()
ceil()
ceil()
constrain()
floor()
pow()
round()
sq()
sqrt()

This is in addition to the standard math operators. You are expected to use each of the
following at least once.

Addition/Subtraction (+, -)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/) (remember to avoid divide by 0 errors)
Modulo (%)
Use at least one random number generator (random()).
Use at the map function at least once (map()).
