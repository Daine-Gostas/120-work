# Week 6 Homework Summary
## Work Summary
Ok, this week's assignment was very difficult. I'm typically really bad at coding, and typically really bad when it comes to understanding math, that being said, even though it was basic math, mixing it with coding was a whole new level of difficulty for me. Regardless, I slowly figured out the majority of what I was doing but I definitely need more practice with this material for later assignments.

## Steps Taken
So I basically started with creating the objects needed in order to start the project off with a basic circle. From there I twiddled with the different algorithms I could use until I eventually created a square full of white random circles of different shapes and sizes. From there I edited the colors of said circles and put them in different locations and using different algorithms to have them change in accordance with each other. Basically randomness was key here. Once I created the random circle creations and designated them to their correct areas, I then made an interactive circle that changes size with the mouse's cursor location.

## Problems / Issues
My main problem came with figuring out why the random circles wouldn't change color when my object I created for the circle colors was set to random. I eventually gave up and gave the circles their own unique colors, but later reincorporated the color problem into the interactive black and white circle, thus making the most of it.
Besides that, my main issue came with figuring out how to the loop works with the algorithms and how to get the objects to work with the draw function. A lot of trial and error eventually got the job done.

## Things I Learned
I learned what the different algorithms due in terms of randomly generating numbers, however I still don't have a complete grasp on why those algorithms directly relate to the ellipses I created. I know they did effect them, and which ones they effected, but I'm still not 100% on understanding it.

## Did I help other students?
Unfortunately not. :(
