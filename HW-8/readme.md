# Week 8 Homework Summary

## Work Summary
For this week's assignment I learned about the many different kinds of loops used in coding and what each of their purposes are. From there, and with a lot of help from the MART Website [Shiffman tutorials](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1/modules/week-8/shiffman-loops/), I created a simple animated sketch that consisted of for, while, and nested loops, along with an if statement to provide continuous animation.

## Steps Taken
The steps I took mainly consisted of watching and reading the tutorials, following along with Shiffman, and learning how to create different loops and what each loop did. After the first video, I made a basic animation that consisted of color change and movement relating to the position of the mouse, which then had me surprised to see Shiffman do similar things in his next video. Because of this, I then chose to add an animated background and to alter the movement of each colorful line drastically.

## Problems / Issues
The main problems I had consisted of not fully understanding and being able to follow along with the website's instructions. I was only able to really get a good grasp of the different loops after I had watched the tutorials and later looking back, however I feel this isn't the website but simply because I have a much easier time learning things done in front of me and watching it step by step with both visual and audible assistance.

## Things I Learned
I learned how loops make coding a lot easier when it comes to creating patterns and grids, and the different uses loops have besides that.

## Did I help other students?
Not this week but hopefully in the weeks to come, I am officially caught up! Woohoo!
